Headquartered in Austin, Texas, it designs, manufactures, and sells battery electric vehicles (BEVs), stationary battery energy storage devices from home to grid-scale, solar panels and solar shingles, and related products and services.\\nTesla was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning as Tesla Motors. Its name is a tribute to the inventor and electrical engineer Nikola Tesla. In February 2004, Elon Musk led Tesla\\'s first funding round and became the company\\'s chairman; in 2008, he was named chief executive officer. In 2008, the company began production of its first car model, the Roadster sports car. This was followed by the Model S sedan in 2012, the Model X SUV in 2015, the Model 3 sedan in 2017, the Model Y crossover in 2020, the Tesla Semi truck in 2022, and the Cybertruck pickup truck in 2023.\\nTesla is one of the world\\'s most valuable companies in terms of market capitalization. Starting in July 2020, it has been the world\\'s most valuable automaker. From October 2021 to March 2022, Tesla was a trillion-dollar company, the seventh US company to reach that valuation. Tesla exceeded $1 trillion in market capitalization again between November 2024 and February 2025. In 2024, the company led the battery electric vehicle market, with 17.6% share. In 2023, the company was ranked 69th in the Forbes Global 2000.\\nTesla has been the subject of lawsuits, boycotts, government scrutiny, and journalistic criticism, stemming from allegations of multiple cases of whistleblower retaliation, worker rights violations such as sexual harassment and anti-union activities, safety defects leading to dozens of recalls, the lack of a public relations department, and controversial statements from Musk, including overpromising on the company\\'s driving assist technology and product release timelines.\\n\\nPage: History of Tesla, Inc.\\nSummary: Tesla, Inc. is an electric vehicle manufacturer and clean energy company founded in San Carlos, California in 2003 by American entrepreneurs Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. The company is named after Serbian-American inventor Nikola Tesla. Tesla is the world\\'s leading electric vehicle manufacturer by market cap. As of 2023, Tesla\\'s global vehicle sales were 1.77 million units annually, the 14th-highest total among auto manufacturers worldwide.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: Criticism of Tesla, Inc.\\nSummary: Tesla, Inc. has been criticized for its cars, workplace culture, business practices, and occupational safety. Many of the criticisms are also directed toward Elon Musk, the company\\'s CEO and Product Architect. Critics have also accused Tesla of deceptive marketing, unfulfilled promises, and fraud. The company is currently facing criminal and civil investigations into its self-driving claims. Critics have highlighted Tesla\\'s downplaying of issues, and Tesla\\'s alleged retaliation against several whistleblowers.\\nThe safety and quality of Tesla cars and services have been questioned. There have been hundreds of reports of sudden unintended acceleration, brake failures, and \"whompy wheels\" – collapsing wheels due to faulty car suspension. These safety and quality problems have been compounded in the past by the poor wait times of Tesla\\'s customer service. Some features such as Autopilot, Full Self-Driving beta, and Passenger Play (a feature allowing riders to play Tesla games while in motion) have been criticized for their careless deployment. Critics have noted that some Tesla cars have had poor build quality due to rushed testing, leading to a high ratio of flawed vehicles. Others criticize the company\\'s \"stealth\" vehicle recalls, requiring customers to sign non-disclosure agreements.\\nRelationships between Musk, Tesla board members, employees, and unions have been complicated, partly resulting in a high turnover rate. Employees have reported poor treatment and policies, resulting i', name='wikipedia_search', id='49a55fcd-8db5-4ad4-b579-a5111e89583e', tool_call_id='ee56de3d-8225-4323-addb-5d6e5068c78c'),\n",

       "'Page: Tesla, Inc.\\nSummary: Tesla, Inc. ( TEZ-lə or   TESS-lə), is an American multinational automotive and clean energy company. Headquartered in Austin, Texas, it designs, manufactures, and sells battery electric vehicles (BEVs), stationary battery energy storage devices from home to grid-scale, solar panels and solar shingles, and related products and services.\\nTesla was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning as Tesla Motors. Its name is a tribute to the inventor and electrical engineer Nikola Tesla. In February 2004, Elon Musk led Tesla\\'s first funding round and became the company\\'s chairman; in 2008, he was named chief executive officer. In 2008, the company began production of its first car model, the Roadster sports car. This was followed by the Model S sedan in 2012, the Model X SUV in 2015, the Model 3 sedan in 2017, the Model Y crossover in 2020, the Tesla Semi truck in 2022, and the Cybertruck pickup truck in 2023.\\nTesla is one of the world\\'s most valuable companies in terms of market capitalization. Starting in July 2020, it has been the world\\'s most valuable automaker. From October 2021 to March 2022, Tesla was a trillion-dollar company, the seventh US company to reach that valuation. Tesla exceeded $1 trillion in market capitalization again between November 2024 and February 2025. In 2024, the company led the battery electric vehicle market, with 17.6% share. In 2023, the company was ranked 69th in the Forbes Global 2000.\\nTesla has been the subject of lawsuits, boycotts, government scrutiny, and journalistic criticism, stemming from allegations of multiple cases of whistleblower retaliation, worker rights violations such as sexual harassment and anti-union activities, safety defects leading to dozens of recalls, the lack of a public relations department, and controversial statements from Musk, including overpromising on the company\\'s driving assist technology and product release timelines.\\n\\nPage: Tesla Cybertruck\\nSummary: The Tesla Cybertruck is a battery-electric full-size pickup truck manufactured by Tesla, Inc. since 2023. It was first unveiled as a prototype in November 2019, featuring a distinctive angular design composed of flat, unpainted stainless steel body panels, drawing comparisons to low-polygon computer models.\\nOriginally scheduled for production in late 2021, the vehicle faced multiple delays before entering limited production at Gigafactory Texas in November 2023, with initial customer deliveries occurring later that month. As of 2025, three variants are available: a tri-motor all-wheel drive (AWD) model marketed as the \"Cyberbeast\", a dual-motor AWD model, and a single-motor rear-wheel drive (RWD) \"Long Range\" model. EPA range estimates vary by configuration, from 320 to 350 miles (515 to 565 km). \\nAs of 2025, the Cybertruck is sold in the United States, Mexico, Canada and South Korea. The Cybertruck has been criticized for its production quality and safety concerns while its sales have been described as disappointing.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: Nikola Tesla\\nSummary: Nikola Tesla (10 July 1856 – 7 January 1943) was a Serbian-American engineer, futurist, and inventor. He is known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electricity supply system.\\nBorn and raised in the Austrian Empire, Tesla first studied engineering and physics in the 1870s without receiving a degree. He then gained practical experience in the early 1880s working in telephony and at Continental Edison in the new electric power industry. In 1884, he immigrated to the United States, where he became a naturalized citizen. He worked for a short time at the Edison Machine Works in New York City before he struck out on his own. With the help of partners to finance and market his ideas, Tesla set up laboratories and companies in New York to develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices. His AC induction motor and related polyphase AC patents, licensed by Westinghouse Electric in 1888, earn'"
